## Remotely Connecting 
1. Once you have both VScode installed, open a terminal in VScode. In the terminal using your own personal identification letters for the class you will be able to access your personal information from that account on a different system. 
2. In the terminal you want to type out `ssh cs15lwi23amb@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
   - The first nine combination of letters and numbers are the course specific accounts. The last three are specific to your own personal accounts. (in my case it is amb)
4. Once putting in this command, espically if it is the first time you are connecting to the server it will ask you if you are sure you want to continue connecting to the server. Since you want to continue type `yes`.
5. It will then prompt you to fill in your password, when you are typing it, it will not show up as anything. However, once you have successfully logged in you should see something like this
